# littlepuzzle

I'm told this little puzzle is more than 2000 years old! Start by moving any of the 4 smallest pieces around. The goal is to move/wiggle the biggest yello piece downward toward the "Opening" at the bottom of the board. Once the biggest piece is at the bottom opening of the board, you win! As you can see, you don't have much room to maneuver.

Note that the program won't work on old IE. It's best if you use either Chrome or Firefox to play [here](https://gugary.github.io/littlepuzzle/).
